# OSI Model

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is an abstract framework used to understand and design network communication. It helps to conceptualize how data travels from one device to another across a network.

## What is the OSI model?

The OSI model is **a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology**.  

> ⚠️ Note: The OSI model is not tangible. It does not perform any network functions by itself. Its purpose is to help us understand complex interactions in networking systems.

## Organization of the OSI Model

The OSI model is organized **from the lowest level to the highest level**, consisting of **seven layers**:

| Layer | Name | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| 7 | Application | Application-specific communication | HTTP, SNMP, FTP |
| 6 | Presentation | Data translation and encryption | SSL, JPEG, ASCII |
| 5 | Session | Managing sessions and connections | RPC, NetBIOS |
| 4 | Transport | Reliable and unreliable delivery | TCP, UDP |
| 3 | Network | Routing and addressing | IP, ICMP |
| 2 | Data Link | Frame transmission over physical medium | Ethernet, MAC addresses |
| 1 | Physical | Physical transmission of bits | Electrical signals, light, radio |

## Layers in Focus

For this project, we mainly focus on:

### Transport Layer
- Responsible for end-to-end communication.
- Protocols: **TCP** (reliable) and **UDP** (unreliable).

### Network Layer
- Responsible for logical addressing and routing.
- Protocols: **IP**, **ICMP** (used in ping).

## Questions Recap
