The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology

# Organization of the OSI Model

The OSI model is organized from the lowest level to the highest level, consisting of seven layers:

| Layer | Name | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| 7 | Application | Application-specific communication | HTTP, SNMP, FTP |
| 6 | Presentation | Data translation and encryption | SSL, JPEG, ASCII |
| 5 | Session | Managing sessions and connections | RPC, NetBIOS |
| 4 | Transport | Reliable and unreliable delivery | TCP, UDP |
| 3 | Network | Routing and addressing | IP, ICMP |
| 2 | Data Link | Frame transmission over physical medium | Ethernet, MAC addresses |
| 1 | Physical | Physical transmission of bits | Electrical signals, light, radio |

## Layers in Focus

Transport Layer
- Responsible for end-to-end communication
- Protocols: TCP (reliable) and UDP (unreliable)

Network Layer
- Responsible for logical addressing and routing
- Protocols: IP, ICMP (used in ping)
